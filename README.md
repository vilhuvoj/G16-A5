# G16-A5

A5 - Project reflection

## Learning experience
We have started this course only with limited knowledge about OpenBIM format equal to OpenBIM Level [Modeller](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/). It is also relevant to note only one of us had previous experience with basic coding.  
Throughout Assignment 1 to [Assignment 3](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A3) we have developed a code able to extract information from an IFC model and project it into an excel file. In [Assignment 4](https://github.com/vilhuvoj/G16-A4) we have enhanced the code with the ability to modify the IFC model.
At the end, we have definitely achieved OpenBIM Level higher than [Self Learner](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/), probably around low [OpenBIM Ontologist](https://timmcginley.github.io/41934/Roles/).
Even though we learned the principles of an IFC format and how to extract and add information, there is still a lot to learn, best done with practice.

## Use of OpenBIM in the future
As the industry is evolving, aiming to cost reduction, sustainability and optimization, we expect to come in contact with OpenBIM formats, although probably not directly working with it with our current goals.

## Process of developing the tutorial
As we don't expect to work with OpenBIM in our thesis, we do not think it helped us define and answer questions needed for our thesis.
We were satisfied with the amount of freedom given to the students, although feedback on each assignment would be very much appreciated, as we were unsure whether we were aiming towards the correct goal of the course.
We were also satisfied with the given tools to work with. But if it was possible to add more, it would definitely help.

## Received feedback
The feedback addressed the use case we have identified both in the text and the IFC model opened in BlenderBIM. A few details about the use case scenario could have been added.
The use case was well modeled, although access to a proper database was mentioned as a possible problem in actually making use of it. The GitHub was also mentioned to be set up well so thatâ€™s technically modelling.
The project was clearly scoped.

## Our future for Advanced use of OpenBIM
We are unlikely to use OpenBIM tools in our thesis.
Over the next decade, it is probable that we will encounter the OpenBIM format in our professional journeys. This course has provided us with a comprehensive understanding of its functionality and potential applications. Consequently, we have established a solid foundation to leverage when needed in our future endeavors.
